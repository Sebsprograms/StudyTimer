        <h1>Study Timer & Breaks</h1>
        <p>
            Andrew Huberman’s 10 Second Study Pause Technique is a unique way to improve focus and concentration while studying. It works by taking a 10-second break every 5-10 minutes (random) while studying. This break can be used to close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, or just sit in silence. Doing this helps to refocus your energy and attention allowing you to stay focused for longer.
        </p>

        The 10-second break gives your brain time to process and store the information you’ve just learned. It also allows for better creative thinking and problem-solving. This technique is ideal for people who have difficulty focusing on one task for extended periods of time. It allows for a brief break that can help to reduce feelings of restlessness and boredom.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 10 Second Study Pause Technique can be used for any form of studying. Whether it’s reading a textbook, writing an essay, or studying a foreign language. It can also be used in the workplace to improve productivity.
