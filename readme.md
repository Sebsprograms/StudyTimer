# 10 Second study timer
## Spec

A study timer that can be started, stopped and reset.
The timer is designed to play an indicator sound randomly every 5 - 10 minutes ~ and records at which time interval the sound occured. 

### What & Why

The indicator sound should be used to take a 10 second break from studying.

The 10 second study timer works by allowing the brain to take a short break in order to refocus and retain the information. The break helps to reduce restlessness, boredom, and fatigue that can happen with extended periods of studying. It also allows for better creative thinking and problem solving. Taking brief breaks while studying can help to improve productivity and focus.
